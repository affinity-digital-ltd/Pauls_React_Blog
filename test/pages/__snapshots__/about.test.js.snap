                I’m Paul and I am currently a student of the full stack web development course at {Pro}Coders in Leeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.

                  <p>
                    Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.

                    I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.

                  I’m Paul and I am currently a student of the full stack web development course at {Pro}Coders in Leeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.

                    I’m Paul and I am currently a student of the full stack web development course at {Pro}Coders in Leeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.

                      My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.

                      Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.

                    <p>
                      This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.

                      I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the {Pro}Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.
