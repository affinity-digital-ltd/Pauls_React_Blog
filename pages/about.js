              <p>Iâ€™m Paul and I am currently seeking a role hopefully in a creative digital agency as a Front-End Developer. I have worked for Hitachi Capital as a UI Developer and I also did three weeks commercial experience at Shift Commerce working on the Matalan website as part of the ProCoders course I did.</p>
              <p>I passed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development and I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.</p>
              <p>I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the &#123;Pro&#125;Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a developer.</p>
