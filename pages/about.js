              <p>Iâ€™m Paul and I am currently seeking my first role as a Front-End Developer after studying web design and development for the last couple of years.</p>
              <p>My background for the last 7 years is working as a food and commercial photographer mainly with a focus on food and travel and I have my portfolio of over 3000 images on some of the main stock photography sites including Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.</p>
              <p>Although photography is a passion of mine, after releasing my first cookbook (Yummy Eats) which I put together using InDesign I found that I really loved graphic design and wanted to pursue it further.</p>
              <p>This led me into the world of web development in which I have been studying ever since. I have passed my Adobe Dreamweaver CC ACA exam and completed a Level 3 RQF course in web design and development. I also completed the first year of the FdA Creative and Digital Industries course at the University Centre at Wakefield College in which I passed with merit.</p>
              <p>I decided not to do my second year at university due to the lecturer leaving the course and a suitable lecturer not been available for the second year. This led me into looking for other web development courses and I found that the &#123;Pro&#125;Coders course covered the skills I would need to pursue a career as a developer.</p>
